Instructions:

1. Do 'git clone https://github.com/douglas-vaz/8tracks-lyrics-chrome.git'. This should create a folder called '8tracks-lyrics-chrome' in your current directory. 
(If you don't have git, use the download as zip option and extract the files)

2. In Chrome, click on the Options(Customize) menu icon, go to Tools -> Extensions

3. Check 'Developer Mode'. Click on 'Load Unpacked extension...' and select the 8tracks-lyrics-chrome folder from the file browser.

4. Go to any 8tracks mix, (like http://8tracks.com/mistcrafter/my-infinite-dream-mix). Hit the Play button and then press the Get button in the sidebar (under Similar Mixes)
